# AiJavaSnake

This project used provided materials, but the functionality of the programming is all my own work. To access the project go 
 src/com/gradescope/spampede/ 

This is where the code is. I personally completed most of SpampedeBrain, SpampedeData and Spampede Display. 

The goal was to create an AI that searched for the "spam" food in the snake-esque game. Specifically I used BST's and queus/breadth first search.
